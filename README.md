# SpringPetClinic

## General Spring Study

Based on: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic

A website that allows the user to manage entries for pets, veterinarians, owners and visits. Thymeleaf based interface that is taken as is and integrated to the source code. Monolithic multi-module project.

Was a learning project before diving deeper into the microservices project at https://github.com/eartar/SpringCloudApp

## Utilized Technologies
 - Spring MVC
 - Spring Bootstrap
 - Spring Data JPA
 - JUnit5 (to learn the grips, has very low test coverage)
 - Lombok
 - CircleCI integration
 - Maven
 - H2 database
